# CA Chat (AKA Chat App Chat)

To demonstrate what I have learned about full-stack web development, I have decided to create a simple chat app in TypeScript with React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. It also uses library such as React Router, toast, etc.

## Why I am not using Next.js or other higher-level frameworks?

This is meant to be a basic demonstration of everything I have learnt in full-stack web development. Next.js provides useful routing and navigation utility, but I want to get into the lower level to see how it works. It is important these tools before moving on to more advanced technology.
